		   The film tells the story of Dan Millman as a locally famous gymnast who dreams of winning a National Championship competition. 
		   Dan attempts to compensate for the restlessness by running along streets before sunrise. 
		   At a car-service station, he encounters an old man who seems to know more about Dan's problem than Dan himself knows, whom Dan later nicknames "Socrates". Dan is unsettled by Socrates' .
		   Socrates became Dan's personal trainer.And hard and impatient with the teachings taught by Socrates who taught about theory. One day, Dan drives recklessly, and his motorcycle collides with a car that ran a red light, causing his right femur bone to shatter. He is rushed to a hospital, 
		   where a metal bar is placed in his leg to maintain its leg. 
		   As a result, his gymnastic coach believes that Dan cannot compete in the National competition. 
		   And lack of self -confidence. Scrotes gave words of encouragement to Dan for the spirit back with the sport of gymanst. Many people think Dan canâ€™t successfully join and win because of the condition of his legs. Finally, Dan managed to prove to coaches and friends that he could join and win a gold medal.
		   From this film, I gained a lot of useful lessons and knowledge. We must always be patient in facing trials. 
		    In addition, we must always think positively in order to face problems
